# SpotCheck: Location Verification with ZK-RISC0

## Overview

SpotCheck is a proof-of-concept project that demonstrates the use of zero-knowledge proofs for location verification. It utilizes the RISC0 zkVM (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) to create a secure and private way to prove a user's location without revealing exact coordinates.

## Features

- Secure location verification using zero-knowledge proofs
- Integration with RISC0 zkVM for trustless computation
- Separation of host and guest code for enhanced security
- Asynchronous operations for efficient processing

## Prerequisites

- Rust programming language (latest stable version)
- RISC0 toolchain
- Cargo and rustc
